American Community Survey 5-Year Data (2009-2022)
Detailed Tables contain the most detailed estimates on all topics for all geographies. The data are presented as estimates.  

Subject Tables provide a span of information on a particular ACS subject presented in the format of both estimates and percentages. 

Data Profiles contain broad social, economic, housing, and demographic information. The data are presented as estimates and percentages. 

Comparison Profiles are similar to Data Profiles but also include comparisons with past-year data. The current 5-year data are compared with the preceding non-overlapping 5-year data (e.g. 2018-2022 ACS 5-year estimates compared to 2013-2017 ACS 5-year estimates) and include statistical significance testing.
